# 4 in a row

Exercise:
- Program the classic game 4 in a row as a web-based online game.
- Use HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Use the jQuery and Bootstrap libraries.
- Establish a responsive design that works well on both mobiles, tablets and computers.
- Work agile with SCRUM. Starting from the product owner's wireframes and breaking down to user stories. Break down user stories into tasks and points of poker planning. Work in sprinter (2 pieces) and report after each sprint.
- Follow wireframes. They show that each player should be able to enter a name, that rules of play should be available, etc.
- Version Manage Your Code With Git. Create a repo on GitHub.
- Normal game mode is that two human players play it in front of the same computer / phone / tablet.
- A hiscore list will be stored (suggested using the jsonflex library ). You get higher in the list the fewer moves you win the game on.
- The game should know when someone has won or when the tiles are over. And then show the winner.
- In consultation with the product owner, select a complete Bootstrap theme (from free webmasters) and use this.
- Use classes / OOP to solve the task, eg. a class for players, one for board etc.
